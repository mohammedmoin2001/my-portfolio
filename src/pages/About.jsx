      <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
        I'm <strong>Mohamad Moin Chisti</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack and Web Developer
        with a strong academic background in Information Science and Engineering. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and scalable web applications that solve real-world problems and deliver a smooth user experience.

      <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 mt-4">
        I have hands-on experience in developing both frontend and backend solutions using technologies like
        <strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, Java, SQL</strong>, and more. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and constantly strive to improve both my technical and soft skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 mt-4">
        What drives me is my curiosity to explore new tools and frameworks, my ability to learn quickly, and my desire to collaborate in team environments to create something impactful. I'm not just a coder—I’m a problem solver and a lifelong learner who loves technology and innovation.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Outside of development, I enjoy traveling, playing football, participating in college events, and connecting with others in the tech community.
